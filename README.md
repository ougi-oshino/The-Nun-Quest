Simple python text-based adventure erotic game (NSFW)

The games has 3 main routes with various branches.
It can be played running `python3 main.py` or `python main.py`

You need to have a python 3 enviroment set up.
You can get Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/

if you are new to progamming see [Python's Getting Started Guide](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
I recommend Thonny as a starter python IDE, you can also use VScode and Atom.
